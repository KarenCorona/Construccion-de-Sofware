  <h3 id= "Neuro">  1.1 What are neural networks? </h3>
Neural networks are a cool blend of biology and computer science, inspired by our brain’s setup to tackle complicated computing tasks. Essentially, they’re algorithms designed to spot patterns and make sense of sensory data, which lets them do a ton of stuff like recognizing faces, understanding spoken words, making predictions, and understanding natural language.

  <h3 id= "Activ"> 3.2 Activation Functions</h3>
As we said before, activation functions play a pivotal role in determining the output of a neural network. They are mathematical equations that determine whether a neuron should be activated or not. Activation functions introduce non-linear properties to the network, enabling it to learn complex data patterns and perform tasks beyond mere linear classification, which is essential for deep learning models. Here, we delve into several key types of activation functions and their significance:
